==== Locate Command

To navigate from a starting address to the address of the first person in the list: +
Type `locate 1 a/nus`

ie `favorite 3`.
====

`Computer Science`.

To list the people belonging to the group `ComputerScience` at index 3, +

Type `viewGroup 3`

[NOTE]
====
- Other non-group related commands can still be executed when we are viewing a group. However,
these commands will take effect on the full contact list instead of locally within the group.
- Eg. using `delete 3` to delete `Mark Zuckerberg` deletes the person from the contacts rather than from the group. This is where the next command comes in
====

==== Edit Group Command

This command allows the user to perform three functions:  +
====
- change group name

- delete a person from the group
====

To change the group name of group `Demo_Day_Group` to `Testathon_Day_Group` +

Type `viewGroup Avengers` to select the group, then, using the index of `Tony Stark` in the group, +
